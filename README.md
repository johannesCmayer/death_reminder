# Death Reminder
This app shows you how long you till have to life and lets you once a day decrement the counter of how many days you have left to life. There are also some random particle animations, showing you whether you redeemed your day already.

The values are calculated based on your date of birth and an average life expectancy (that you have to provide).

Only tested for android.
